## Data Source

This project uses the Hong Kong Horse Racing Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gdaley/hkracing), which provides comprehensive racing information from the Hong Kong Jockey Club. The dataset includes:

### Dataset Contents
- `races.csv`: Contains race event details (distance, track conditions, timing)
- `runs.csv`: Individual horse performance in each race (finish position, weights, ratings)

### Dataset Statistics
- Total race records: 79,447
- Unique horses: 4,405
- Total races: 6,348
- Win rate: 8.01% (balanced by multiple horses per race)

### How to Obtain the Data
1. Visit the [Hong Kong Horse Racing Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gdaley/hkracing)
2. Download the dataset (Kaggle account required)
3. Place the downloaded files in the `data` directory:
   ```bash
   data/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ races.csv
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ runs.csv
   ```

### Automatic Data Download
The project includes automatic data download functionality using the Kaggle API. When you run the model, it will:
1. Check for existing data files
2. Download from Kaggle if not present (requires Kaggle API credentials)
3. Process and prepare the data for training

To set up Kaggle API credentials:
1. Go to your Kaggle account settings
2. Generate an API token
3. Save `kaggle.json` in `~/.kaggle/` directory

   mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
   mv kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
   chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
   ```

## Data Engineering

### Feature Engineering Process

1. **Physical Characteristics**
   - **Height**: Derived from declared weight using typical Thoroughbred proportions
     - Average height: 163 cm (typical for Thoroughbreds)
     - Converted from declared weight using scaling factor
     - Mean height in dataset: 180.1 cm
   
   - **Weight**: Converted from pounds to kilograms
     - Used actual_weight from runs.csv
     - Applied standard conversion (√ó 0.45359237)
     - Mean weight: 55.7 kg (includes jockey and equipment)

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - **Speed Calculation**
     ```python
     speed = distance / finish_time
     ```
   
   - **Stride Length**: Normalized speed as proxy
     ```python
     stride_length = speed / speed.mean()
     ```
   
   - **Training Speed**: Direct from speed calculations
     - Filled missing values with mean
     - Used as key performance indicator

3. **Derived Features**
   - **Win Rate**: Calculated per horse
     ```python
     win_rate = wins / total_races
     ```
   
   - **Recovery Time**: Estimated from win rate
     ```python
     recovery_time = 20 - (win_rate * 10)
     ```
   
   - **Heart Rate**: Estimated from speed
     ```python
     heart_rate = 130 + (speed / speed.max() * 40)
     ```

4. **Categorical Features**
   - **Temperament**: Derived from speed quartiles
     - Categories: ['Calm', 'Energetic', 'Nervous']
     - Used safe quantile cutting to handle duplicates
   
   - **Training Response**: Based on horse_rating quartiles
     - Categories: ['Poor', 'Fair', 'Good', 'Excellent']
     - Handled duplicate values in quantile calculation

### Data Processing Challenges & Solutions

1. **Duplicate Values in Categorical Creation**
   - **Challenge**: `pd.qcut` failing on duplicate values
   - **Solution**: Implemented `safe_qcut` function using rank method
     ```python
     def safe_qcut(series, n, labels):
         try:
             return pd.qcut(series, n, labels=labels)
         except ValueError:
             ranked = series.rank(method='first')
             return pd.qcut(ranked, n, labels=labels)
     ```

2. **Missing Values**
   - Filled using column means for numerical features
   - Maintained data integrity while handling gaps

3. **Unit Conversions**
   - Standardized all measurements to metric system
   - Ensured realistic value ranges for horse characteristics

4. **Feature Scaling**
   - Normalized speed-based features
   - Scaled physical measurements to realistic ranges

### Data Quality Checks

The data processing pipeline includes several quality checks:

1. **Statistical Validation**
   - Verifies reasonable ranges for physical measurements
   - Checks win rate distribution
   - Validates feature correlations

2. **Completeness Checks**
   - Monitors missing value percentages
   - Ensures critical features are populated

3. **Consistency Verification**
   - Cross-references race results
   - Validates temporal sequences

### Sample Data Generation

For development and testing, we implemented a sample data generator that:
- Creates realistic horse racing data
- Maintains feature distributions similar to real data
- Generates correlated success probabilities based on physical characteristics
